# Micro.blog Navigation List Plug-in

Creates a blog page that lists the blog's static pages and post categories. In other words, very basic site map.

The address of this page will be [https://blogname/pages/](https://blogname/pages/)

As an example, for my blog, the navigation list is at [https://thedimpau.se/pages/](https://thedimpau.se/pages/)
