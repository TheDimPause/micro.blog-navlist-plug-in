# Micro.blog Navigation List Plug-in

Creates a blog page that lists the blog's static pages and post categories. In other words, very basic site map.

The address of this page will be [https://blogname/pages/](https://blogname/pages/)

As an example, for my blog, the navigation list is at [https://thedimpau.se/pages/](https://thedimpau.se/pages/)

_The plug-in 1.0.6 update gives the option to have the navigation list page link to be used wherever you choose!_

Prior to plug-in version 1.0.6 a link to this list page was automatically added to the site's main navigation menu. **This is no longer the case.**

If you do want the link to appear in your site's main menu when the plug-in has been installed, create a new Micro.blog page with an appropriate title, make the contents of the page be the address 

[https://blogname/pages/](https://blogname/pages/)

and make sure the **Include this page in your blog navigation** box is ticked.

I felt this change in the update is more flexible - the link to the navigation list can be named and positioned as desired!
